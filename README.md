# Snake-Water-Game-Using-pyttsx32
This is a two-player game where each player chooses one object.  As we know, there are three objects, snake, water, and gun. So, the result will be 
Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.
In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.
